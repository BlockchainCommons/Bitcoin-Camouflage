`onlynet` is a config option in Bitcoin Core that allows you to control outbound connections based on type of network (ipv4, ipv6, onion, i2p).


What are the isssues with this option?

~~~
1. Some users are not aware that `onlynet` is only for outbound connections

2. Outbound connections are still made to other networks in some cases which PR #22651 is trying to fix

3. More users have started experimenting and trying different combinations since i2p was added
~~~


How can we solve these issues?

~~~
1. Change name of `onlynet` to `outnet` which looks less likely because it will break things for some users. Other possible solution is to educate users. I hope this post also helps few users.

2. Few things are suggested by Wladimir van der Laan in this comment while reviewing another related PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22648#discussion_r696535966

3. This is not an issue, its better if more people are using `onlynet` and trying different combinations. If you find any bugs, report them by creating issue in Bitcoin Core repository.
